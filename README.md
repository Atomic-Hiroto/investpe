## Overview
I started by building the ticker and navbar/footer since these elements are shared across pages.

Next, I created a raw HTML structure based on the Figma design, to determine which divs needed flexbox and establish the overall box model.

The main challenges were building the complex CSS components like the stacked tilted cards and navbar dropdown, which required some debugging to get right.

I added extra features like hover effects and responsiveness for sections to improve the user experience.
